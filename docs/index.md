## What’s this community all about?

The Single Source Publishing Community (SSPC) is a network of
stakeholders from the Open Science community that are interested in
[Single Source Publishing][] (SSP) for scholarly purposes – developing
open-source software and advocacy.

## What is Single Source Publishing?

> Single Source Publishing is an approach to publishing workflows to
> easily produce diverse publication output formats from only a single
> data source – e.g., from one dataset in Markdown or XML to make a
> multi-format publications as HTML, PDF, and JATS/XML, etc.

There are many different approaches to SSP and a variety of benefits of
SSP on different aspects of the research lifecycle. Thus, a goal of the
community is to be a meeting place to exchange ideas from these diverse
practices.

Let’s collaborate more and compete less!

## Who can join the community?

The community is open to newcomers and experts interested in
independent, interoperable and standard-driven approaches to scholarly
publishing.

## What’s going on here?

A number of activities are organised by the community:

- a [discussion board][] to act as a place for Q&As and coordination;
- as monthly ‘[SSPC Show & Tell][]’ where participants will be invited
  to show off their products, projects, and research; lastly
- occasional BarCamps / Book Dashes aimed at publishing guides on key
  SSP topics.
